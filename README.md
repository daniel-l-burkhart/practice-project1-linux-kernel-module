# practice-project1-linux-kernel-module


Part 2:
Finish the requirements in Part I assignment of textbook. (Follow the steps and create a kernel module simple and then try to load and remove it).

Part 3:
Download an incomplete version of simple-solution.c and the corresponding makefile Makefile_2 (no need to change the content of this file except for the name; see Note 1 below) from D2L. Follow the content in Part II of the textbook and add code in simple-solution.c to finish the Part II assignment. Note that we have changed the struct birthday by adding a string element “name”. In your program, the name of the first struct birthday element should be your full name.
